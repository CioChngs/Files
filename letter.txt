Dear cute Hakuna,

I wanted to start this letter by wishing you a warm and loving "Merry Christmas." First, please accept my sincerest apologies for any moment I may have caused you to feel upset. I never intend to hurt you, and if I did, it was completely by accident.

You are the one who fills my heart with so much joy. Every single day, you're on my mind, and just thinking about you brings a smile to my face. There's something so magical about the way you touch my heart with everything you do, even without realizing it. I always strive to make sure you feel nothing but happiness and peace. If I ever upset you, I want you to know it was never intentional.

I’m not here for the short term. I’m not here to take up your time without purpose. I want to build a life, a beautiful future, and a story with you. My heart belongs to you, and I want to spend every moment of my life waking up by your side.

I am here for the long journey. I don’t want to go anywhere without you. Words can't fully express how much you mean to me, but I do know this — I’m so deeply afraid of losing you, and I want you in my life forever.

Merry Christmas and enjoy the time, sweetie. Love you more than yesterday, but less than tomorrow.

With all my love,
Sincerely, Kevin
